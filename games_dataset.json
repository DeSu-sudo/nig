To get to the end, all you have to do is guide the cube through many dangerous areas on the map. But this is not an easy job. To get good control choices, you need to understand the lively beats at each level. It's okay if you don't want to use background music. Just practice a lot and try again and again until you win! You should also pay attention to the bright rings and pads. These things can help the figure jump very high. One more thing is that the main figure can change during certain parts. Additionally, it is very important to understand how each one moves to get good results."
